# ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions
Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview. If you don't know the answer a good tip is to answer a simpler version of the question.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

INSTRUCTOR EXAMPLE: What is a conditional statement?

  Your answer:

<!-- //A condtional statment is a statment that returns a true or false response. A condtional statmemts also means that one is equal to another -->
<!-- When I think of condtional of statments, I think of a statment that is clear in instruction and has a clear input that in turn produces a clear output. -->

  Researched answer:

<!-- Condtional statements  have well defined instructions that produce a input dependent unique output. Condtional staments are like flow charts and help you create logic in your code. They include else/if statements and usually do return true/false statements also known as Boolean Values. -->

1. What is git? What is the difference between git and Github?

  Your answer:

<!-- Git is where each new version of the new code you create is tracked and Github is the software that stores the code you created. -->


  Researched answer:

<!-- Git is a widley used open tool that is used to manage, share, and develop code. It is usually accessed through the terminal.-->
<!-- Github is is the online network service that allows a developer to upload code generated from Git on to Github in order for the code to be reviewed, share and updated remotley by anyone. One needs the other for code to flow amongst developers.  -->


2. Which JavaScript operators will return a Boolean value?

  Your answer:

  <!-- /Boolean values return True or False -->
  <!-- || OR -->

  Researched answer:

<!-- The OR "||" operator runs a boolean value  -->


3. What is an index? What is the difference between index and value?

  Your answer:

  <!-- An index begins with and classified with a "0" and an index of "0" identifies the first value of an string.
   <!-- A value is the data at a location.

   Ex: ["Cookies", "Milk"]

   index "0" would === "Cookies" 
   value "Cookies" ==== "Cookies" -->

  Researched answer:

<!-- An index is defined by the placement that each character holds in a string.Strings start a 0 index so the count of a string starts at 0. -->

<!-- A value is the variable located with in the string that is representative of something like the xample given above. -->

4. What is iteration?

  Your answer:

<!-- <!-- When you run a code multiple times untill a condtion is met. Iterations are assoicated with loops.-->

  Researched answer:

<!-- When you run a code multiples untill a condtion is met. Examples of an iteration would be a loop because it runs arguments in the process of one after the other and repeatedly. -->
<!-- /You need to know how many times you want to repeat the code and what you want to repeat. --> 

5. Give a brief description of proper pair programming techniques. What are the roles of each person?

  Your answer:

<!-- One person is the driver who is the person writing the code and the other person is the navigator who is the person checking for errors and guiding the driver on the code to be inputted.  -->

  Researched answer:

<!-- Pair programming is when two people write code on a machine. One person writes the code and the others tells the person essentially what code to write.  -->

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. Higher Order Functions:
<!-- functions that accepts functions as parameters and in turn gives you a function. I believe this is when we start talking about the sort and filter functions. -->

2. Jest:
<!-- A Javascript testing framwork used to test java code and ensure its correctness. I believe node command is part of jest? -->

3. Objects:

<!-- An object has three characteristics: 1. State, 2. Behavior and 3. Identiity. An objects has its own sets of variables. -->

4. Method:

<!-- A method is a block of code that only runs when its called and they can only run certain actions just like functions.  -->

5. Classes:
 -->
<!-- Classess is like a framwork for creating objects. Classess are groups of variables of the same grouped in a class.  -->
